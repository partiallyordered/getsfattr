- setsfattr
  - take data in the same format we produce it from `getsfattr`
- make cli like this (i.e. release three binaries: `sfattr`, `getsfattr` and `setfsattr`):
  - getsfattr
  - setsfattr
  - sfattr get
  - sfattr set
    - support something like setfattr set --kv key=value key2=value2 key3=value3?
    - read `man setfattr` on `-v` value encoding and `-x` attribute removal
- glob files? or just lean on shell globs?
- test
- lint
- GH Actions build/release
- Check license is compatible with dependencies
- strip any imaginary windows support
- performance
  - is there a problem?
  - things to try:
    - io_uring
      - not cross-platform- also, my understanding is that this is for queueing dependent syscalls,
          not necessarily for concurrently processing a large number of syscalls, so the advantage
          it *might* have is to remove or amortise syscall overhead for multiple syscalls
- Mac support?
- options?
  - output data types?
    - https://serde.rs/#data-formats
    - table? ("raw text")
    - delimited (i.e. csv/ish)
    - or just let users use CLI converters?
- man page
- help text
